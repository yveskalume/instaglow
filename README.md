TFLite Super Resolution for Android with ESRGAN model

The task of recovering a high resolution (HR) image from its low resolution counterpart is commonly
referred to as Single Image Super Resolution (SISR).
The TFLite model is converted from this implementation hosted on TF Hub. Note that the model we
converted upsamples a 50x50 low resolution image to a 200x200 high resolution image (scale
factor=4).
